## 🏳️‍🌈 A Note from the Creator

The projects in these repos were created by a non-binary/queer individual. **I STRONGLY believe ALL people deserve respect, dignity, and the right to exist authentically.** I believe in compassion over cruelty, understanding over judgment and community over division. I believe that technology should serve everyone and that diversity makes us stronger.

**Most of our tools come preconfigured with drag queen sass and the armor of a queer person.** They're built with fierce energy, unapologetic authenticity, and the resilience that comes from having to fight for your right to exist.

**By using ANY of the tools contained here, you agree to:**
- Respect others regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, disability, or any other aspect of their humanity
- Treat all people with kindness and dignity in your interactions
- Be a good human, both online and off
- Use everything here ethically and responsibly

If you cannot agree to these basic principles of human decency, this is not the place for you.
